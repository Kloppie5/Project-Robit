Player: I start a drinking competition with the cat.
DM: You find a blue, perfectly spherical stone with a piece of rope attached to it.
Player: I dump the entire crate of colorful stones into the bag of holding.
Player: I guess it is now canon that Norbert is uncomfortable around ducks.
Player: I throw out the goblin kamasutra book.
DM: It's a tree in paladin armor hitting a statue, do you want to help the tree or the statue?
Player: Can I use the naked goblin as an improvised weapon?

Player: I steal his jacket. DM: Ok, you get Jack Lumber's lumberjack jacket.
Player: I climb into the tree next to the owl and try to befriend him. DM: Roll for Handle Animal. [3] DM: The owl turns its back to you and takes a shit.
Player: I cast Light on the cat to make him shine pink, so I can use him to distract the group.
Player: I vomit on the stairs. [several minutes later] DM: As you discuss the plan with the hunting party, you hear someone fall down the stairs. Player: I use Vicious Mockery on him!
Player: I want to say "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger", but I guess it technically killed me.
Player: Desire is a tricky thing to ignore. DM: That sentence can be horribly misconstrued. Player: I don't mind that happening.
To a player that looks like a tree: You are not big, you just have big foliage.
Keep doing what you're doing, I'm going to smell the chef.
